# Using Titanic Data in a Logitic Regression Model
I made a logistic regression model for titanic data, which is a model that predicts the probability of an event occurring. THe outcome of a linear regression model is a dependent variable between 0 and 1. This model reminds me of a sigmoid function which gives probability between 0 and 1.
